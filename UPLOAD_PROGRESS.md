## Features Added:

### 1. **Visual Progress Indicator**
- Progress bar showing upload percentage
- Different states: uploading, transcribing, complete, error
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Auto-hide after completion

### 2. **Upload States**
- **Uploading**: White progress bar with percentage
- **Transcribing**: Blue pulsing bar for audio files
- **Complete**: Green checkmark with success message
- **Error**: Red alert with error message

### 3. **Progress Tracking**

## How It Works:

1. **Select File**: Progress indicator appears immediately
2. **Upload Progress**: Shows "Uploading filename.ext (2.5 MB)... 45%"
3. **Transcription** (audio only): Shows "Transcribing audio..." with pulsing bar
4. **Completion**: Shows "Upload complete!" then fades out

## Technical Details:

### Components:
- `UploadProgress`: Main progress component
- Uses Framer Motion for animations
- Integrates with existing upload flow

### State Management:

- `uploadStatus`: idle/uploading/transcribing/complete/error
- Automatic cleanup on completion

### Styling:

- Compact layout above input
- Responsive to different screen sizes

## Future Enhancements:

1. **Real Upload Progress**
   - Use XMLHttpRequest for actual progress events
   - Show upload speed (KB/s)
   - Time remaining estimate

2. **Cancel Upload**
   - Add cancel button during upload
   - Properly abort fetch requests

3. **Multiple Files**
   - Queue system for multiple uploads
   - Individual progress for each file

4. **Retry Failed Uploads**

The progress indicator provides clear visual feedback throughout the entire upload process, ensuring users always know what's happening with their files.
